Description: G-code generator for 3D printers
 PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts 
 them into G-code instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers 
 for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer 
 based on the RepRap toolchain, including all those based on the 
 Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works 
 with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.
